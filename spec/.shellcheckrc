# ShellSpec spec files use a DSL (Describe, It, When, Mock, End) that ShellCheck
# doesn't recognize. These codes are expected for test files:
# - SC2317: DSL keywords appear unreachable
# - SC2329: Mock/stub functions invoked indirectly by tested code
# - SC1091: Sourced plugin path
# - SC3033: add-zsh-hook is valid zsh
# - SC3010: [[ ]] is valid in zsh (specs run under zsh)
